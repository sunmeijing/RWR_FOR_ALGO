$Silicon Valley$ $tech$ $titan$s. $Canadian$ $hockey$ players. African sheikhs. $Muhammad Ali$’s $athletic$ might, bold politics and boundless charisma extended his influence far beyond the world of $championship$ $boxing$. And as news of his $death$ broke, each of these people — and many more — shared their $condolence$s on social media.

Ali was a three-time world $heavyweight$ boxing champion and many who mourned him online were fellow athletic titans. One of the first to respond to his death was the controversial boxing champion $Mike Tyson$.

Ali converted from $Christianity$ to $Islam$ in the 1960s and his death was keenly felt among $Muslim$s in the United States and abroad. On Friday, before Ali died, the $Arab-American$ $novelist$ $Saladin Ahmed$ reflected on his place in Muslim America.

After his death, $Ismail Menk$, the Grand Mufti of $Zimbabwe$, the African country’s highest Islamic religious authority, tweeted his condolences to Ali’s family, as did $Nazem Kadri$, a Muslim-Canadian hockey player for the $Toronto Maple Leafs$, and $Linda Sarsour$, a $Muslim-American$ $civil right$s activist.

As a public speaker, Ali was able to both amuse and inspire, whether in delivering a pointed political critique, or using wit and charm to telegraph his brash self-confidence. Many people shared some of his well-known sayings on social media.

And, perhaps unsurprisingly, $Donald J. Trump$, the famously Twitter-friendly presumptive Republican presidential candidate (who has proposed to bar Muslims from entering the United States), was one of the first people tweet about Ali’s death.

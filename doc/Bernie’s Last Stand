$ANAHEIM$, $Calif.$ — DURING the final days of a most improbable $presidential primary season$, the home to $Disneyland$ was for a time the unhappiest place on earth. Rumbling and roaring his way across California, Senator Bernie Sanders brought his political revolution to the neighborhood of Goofy and Mickey.

“Anybody here work for $Disney$?” he asked the crowd at the Anaheim Convention Center. Dozens of hands went up.

“Anybody here making a living wage working for Disney?” No hands went up. After a shower of boos, Sanders continued, showing little joy in his role as socialist scourge. While Disney paid its C.E.O., Robert A. Iger, more than 40 million in total compensation last year, he noted, adults in mouse costumes were living out of motels, making 11 an hour.

He predicted that ABC, owned by Disney, would not report those remarks. What would you expect of the corporate media? But in fact, the local affiliate of the company, ABC 7, reported the dig on its news.

A day later, $Donald J. Trump$ showed up at the same place. His supporters, mostly older whites, clashed outside with protesters, mostly younger Latinos. All the Trump rally appeared to do was unleash a spasm of airborne hatred.

Sanders, by contrast, made his point about the great economic disparity in American life. His rallies in $California$ — nearly two dozen in all — have drawn the expected crowds: young white Bernie bros in man buns, aging lefties in mildly subversive T-shirts — but also a fair amount of Hispanics and curious political neophytes.

So, mission accomplished, yes? The Bern has been felt, the establishment rattled. Voters are decrying a “rigged economy” run by 1-percenters. Time to go back to Vermont, resuming the virtual anonymity that has characterized his quarter-century in Congress.

Not so fast. The $Bernistas$ and the $candidate$ himself may be on something of a late-stage $kamikaze$ mission. The 74-year-old senator is predicting a win here on Tuesday, and with it enough momentum to sway unpledged delegates at what he says will be a “messy” convention in $Philadelphia$.

That the math is overwhelmingly against him, or that he’s now on a reckless venture, does not seem to matter. As Stephen Colbert noted, Sanders promised to campaign in all 50 states — “51 if you count the state of denial.” The fear among other Democrats is that the $Bernie$-or-bust crowd will bring $Hillary Clinton$ down, either by leaving her badly weakened or by not voting at all in the fall. One poll in May showed that 20 percent of Sanders supporters would actually vote for $Trump$.

To this — a scenario that would produce a billionaire president who does not believe in climate change, and would build a police state to round up 11 million undocumented immigrants — many $Sanders$ supporters respond with an agonized shrug.

“I cannot, right now, bring myself to vote for Hillary Clinton,” said Nora Belrose, who dropped her studies at Purdue to become a field organizer for Sanders in the Bay Area. She was getting ready to knock on doors in $San Francisco$, one of dozens of daily Sanders grass roots activities — from a “Beers and Queers for Bernie” event to a “Bern the Mic” hip-hop fund-raiser. Whether any of this will last longer than an Instagram video is another question.

“$Hillary$ is just too much about the money,” said $Robert Sturgeon$, who is undecided for the $general election$. He used to work at a $Hyundai$ dealership in Southern California, though he is now unemployed, and likes what he hears from Sanders.

His complaint about money is another issue that Sanders has forced the $Democratic Party$ he now wants to lead to confront. The party’s current leaders, says Sanders, are all about “running around into rich people’s homes and raising money.”
